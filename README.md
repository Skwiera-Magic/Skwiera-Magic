06.11.2022 - Just started here, it's really exciting that I have finally decided to make a move in this direction.
So far it was only prework for the bootcamp, that was rather easy but I'm sure that I'll be crying and grinding my teeth couple times before it ends :D

18.11.2022 - First challenge started today, Bootcamp is going rather well, probably because I'm going forward with the material. It's easy when subject is interesting :D
